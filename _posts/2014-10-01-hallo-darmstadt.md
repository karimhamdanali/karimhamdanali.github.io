I have just started a new exciting chapter in my life. New job, new country, a whole new continent! I have just started 
my position as a postdoctoral researcher at the Technische Universit&auml;t Darmstadt.<figure>

</figure>I am working within the [Secure Software Engineering (SSE) group][sseblog] which is led by [Eric Bodden][bodden].
My main focus will be exploring static analysis techniques that can automatically detect misuses of cryptographic APIs
in Java applications.
