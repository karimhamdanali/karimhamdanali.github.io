I am currently a doctoral student in the Computer Science and Engineering department at the University of South Carolina. I am working as a research assistant in the [AISys lab](https://pooyanjamshidi.github.io/AISys/) led by [Dr.Jamshidi](https://pooyanjamshidi.github.io/){:target="_blank"}. My research interests lie in the machine learning system, self-supervised learning, transfer learning, and the application of machine learning in healthcare. 

Before joining the UofSC, I received my bachelor's degree in Statistics and Finance at the Southwestern University of Finance and Economics and a master's degree in Hospital Management at Tsinghua University. I am interested in technology, business, finance, and sports(never cooking); love kids and reading.

Here is my short [CV][cvpdf]{:target="_blank"}.
